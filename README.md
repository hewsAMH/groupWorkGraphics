- commit #1 (837916708feb8f6228205be4fb700e7374c517db) includes everything for part 1 - I  used the original scenographs folder and added Scenegraphs/sgraph/TextScenegraphRenderer.h, then edited Scenegraphs/Controller.cpp Controller::initScenegraph() to create and use the text renderer. 
- commit #2 (de8bc774eda8a8254834273b988c854153872296) includes code for part 2 - added scenegraphmodels/looking-humanoid-commands.txt, scenegraphmodels/sitting-humanoid-commands.txt, scenegraphmodels/courtyard-scene-commands.txt + small edit to Controller to read from courtyard-scene-commands.txt
